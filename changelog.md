To do:

        - [ ] extract metadata from music for progress bar etc
        - [ ] Fix bug so playing a song plays the album from that point
        - [ ] music progress bar
        - [ ] Figure out how to integrate it with my dwmbar.sh
        - [ ] Basically fix the entire bottom window - it needs a lot of attention
