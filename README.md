ncmusic

This is an ncurses client for music. Basically ncpsot, but I don't have Spotify premium and don't like Spotify.

With this in mind, I'm creating a similar client except it's written in Python, as any sensible program is,
but it both takes inspiration from the ncspot program and also I'm possibly going to copy a bunch of the curses code. 

If none of this made sense, you now have documented evidence of my stupidity. If it did, I hope you enjoy!
Love, Iain xoxo
